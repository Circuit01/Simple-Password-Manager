Data Storage
Password data is stored in a JSON file named passwords.json. It is strongly recommended to back up this file regularly to avoid data loss.

Security
Protect your master password at all costs. Do not share it with anyone, and make sure it is strong and unique. This application does not have a password recovery feature, so losing the master password may result in permanent data loss.

Disclaimer
This application is intended for personal use and does not provide the highest level of security. For more robust password management, consider using a dedicated password manager program or service.
